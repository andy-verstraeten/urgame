The game of Ur is a boardgame where
the aim is to race your pieces along
a chosen path around the board. If
all your pieces have completed the
path before the other player you
win the game.

The number of squares you can
move a piece is determined by the
dice you roled. You use 4 pyramid
shaped dice. A dice can either be
1 or 0. The moves are the number
of ones your roll. If you roll 4
zeros you get 4 moves.

You can put a new piece on the board
or move one of your existing pieces.
A piece can not land on a friendly
piece, a piece can not land on an
enemy piece which is on a square
with a rosetta. If a piece lands on
another enemey piece the enemy is
taken off the board and has to start
again on it's path.

Good luck!
